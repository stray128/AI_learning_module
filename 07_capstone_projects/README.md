# Module 7: Capstone Projects

Apply everything you've learned to real-world data challenges.

## Overview

These capstone projects are designed to simulate actual data science work. You'll face messy data, make analytical decisions, and produce actionable insights - just like in a professional setting.

## Projects

### Project 1: Titanic EDA (`project_titanic_eda.ipynb`)
**Problems:** 15 | **Difficulty:** Progressive (Easy to Hard)

Analyze the famous Titanic dataset to understand survival factors:

**What You'll Do:**
- Load and explore passenger data
- Analyze missing data patterns
- Calculate survival rates across different groups
- Create visualizations that tell the story of survival
- Engineer new features (age groups, family size)
- Build a comprehensive analysis dashboard

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- Did "women and children first" actually happen?
- How did passenger class affect survival chances?
- What role did fare and cabin location play?
- Were families more or less likely to survive?

**Skills Applied:**
- Data loading and inspection
- Missing value analysis and imputation
- GroupBy aggregations
- Multiple visualization types
- Feature engineering
- Correlation analysis

### Project 2: Data Cleaning Challenge (`project_data_cleaning.ipynb`)
**Problems:** 15 | **Difficulty:** Progressive (Easy to Hard)

Transform a messy, real-world-style dataset into clean, analysis-ready data:

**What You'll Do:**
- Assess initial data quality
- Remove duplicate records
- Standardize string formatting
- Convert data types appropriately
- Handle missing values strategically
- Detect and handle outliers
- Create a cleaning report
- Validate and save the cleaned dataset

**Challenges You'll Face:**
- Inconsistent string formatting (mixed case, extra spaces)
- Numbers stored as strings
- Multiple types of missing values
- Outliers that could skew analysis
- Duplicate records

**Skills Applied:**
- Data type conversion
- String manipulation
- Missing value imputation
- Outlier detection (IQR method)
- Winsorization
- Documentation and reporting

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Modules 1-6
- Understanding of the full data science workflow

## How to Approach Capstone Projects

1. **Read the entire notebook first** - Understand the full scope before starting
2. **Plan your approach** - Think about what techniques you'll need
3. **Work systematically** - Complete problems in order; they build on each other
4. **Document as you go** - Write comments explaining your reasoning
5. **Review your work** - Check that results make sense

## Grading Yourself

After completing each project, ask yourself:
- Did I handle all edge cases?
- Are my visualizations clear and informative?
- Could someone else understand my analysis?
- What would I do differently next time?

## What's Next?

After completing these capstones, you're ready to:
- Work on your own datasets
- Tackle Kaggle competitions
- Build machine learning models
- Create data-driven reports and dashboards

## Tips for Success

- Don't just get the right answer - understand why it's right
- When stuck, review relevant notebooks from earlier modules
- Real data is messy; expect unexpected issues
- Document your assumptions and decisions
- There's often more than one valid approach
